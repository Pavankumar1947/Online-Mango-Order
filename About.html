                <span>Nature nurtures all. Every seed sown, is a story of life. We’re unapologetically real, and bring the best of nature’s unaltered version. We’re a brand with a purpose. Our quest lies in bringing the freshest fruits & vegetables and making conscious living an informed choice. Today, ever stronger in our pursuit to make mindful eating a second nature, Deep Rooted.Co (DR.Co) is an inventory of all things fresh with over 200+ fruits and vegetables.</span>
                <span>Every bloom is a manifest of patience. We don’t rush the plants. We tide with time. We bring together the wisdom of ancient farming & new-age techniques (Greenhouse, Net-house, Open-fields). With a vested in-house agronomy team and strict vigilance, we take into account every plant that grows on our farms. Our labour of love is consistent in quality, contamination-free, grown responsibly and presented with care.</span>
                <span>Today we’re a family of 5 lakh+ customers, 100+ farmers and an expanse of 200 acres along with a wide sourcing pastu­­­­res that has built our presence. Yes, with every passing sunrise, we’re growing stronger and we’re rooting deeper to bring you happiness every day.</span>
