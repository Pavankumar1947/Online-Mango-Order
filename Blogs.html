                <h2>Farmer Tales: Journey of a Farmer from SRINIVASAPUR </h2>
                
                <article >An account of  Mr. Sreenavasalu taking us through his journey of cultivating mangoes for generations</article> <br><br>
                <span>As a child, I recall accompanying my father on trips to our mango farms, where I was first introduced to the king of fruits. The peacefulness of the farms, with their expansive orchards overflowing with fruit, left a lasting impression on me. Little did I know that years later, in my 50s, mangoes would become not only my livelihood, but also a passion of mine.

                    At the end of each season, as the orchards are stripped of their fruit, I am struck by the absence of the once-bountiful mangoes. However, this marks the beginning of a new chapter. In Andhra Pradesh, where my orchard is located, the mango season comes to an end in May. During the months of May and June, the orchards are largely inactive, as it is crucial for the plants to rest. From July onwards, we begin pruning and preparing the orchard for the upcoming season. This is vital for maintaining the health of the plants and ensuring that they receive the necessary nutrients for a successful harvest.</span>
